## ## Lenovo Z50-70 DSDT patches by Zaid-Rahawi based on RehabMan's github repos.

This set of patches/makefile can be used to patch your Haswell Lenovo Z50-70 DSDT/SSDTs.  It relies heavily on already existing laptop DSDT patches at github here: https://github.com/RehabMan/Laptop-DSDT-Patch.. There are also post install scripts that can be used to create and install the kexts the are required for this laptop series.

The current repository actually uses only on-the-fly patches vai config.plist and an additional SSDT, SSDT-HACK.aml.
